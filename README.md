# gene_transcripts
several transcripts from one gene

The human genome contains approximately 3.3 billion DNA bases in which only 7% of genetic sequence codes for proteins. Within the NCBI-NIH database, there are over 100,000 different proteins but only 19,000 - 20,000 genes exist. Therefore, one gene may contain several transcript expression (or several different proteins).

Write a genetic display of a gene that contains various isoproteins(different proteins) from that same gene. For example, gene(A) contains 30 exons that codes for the 1st isoprotein whereas the same gene (in a different cell type) uses 25 exons to code for 2nd isoprotein. Thus, a difference of 5 exons between the two different proteins that come from the same chromosomal (gene) sequence. State the difference of exons in terms of amino acid sequence. The amino acid sequence creates the specific protein structure.
